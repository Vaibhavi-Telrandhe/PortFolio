    description: "I am currently in the final year of my Btech in Computer Science and Engineering at Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology (SGGSIE&T), Nanded, with a CGPA of 8.13. My academic journey here has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science and software development, focusing on subjects such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management Systems, Web Development, and Software Engineering. I have a strong command of C++, which I regularly use to solve Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) problems, allowing me to sharpen my logical thinking and coding efficiency. My interest in development led me to master both frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as full-stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).Beyond academics, I actively participate in technical workshops, coding contests, and hands-on projects, which have significantly contributed to my practical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. These experiences have helped me understand how to build robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications from end to end.",
